# EXP 08 - LANDSCAPE FOLIAGE

## AIM:
To Create a landscape, add foliage, apply landscape material.

## ALGORITHM:

#### STEP 1: Create a new landscape:

* In the Modes panel, under the Place tab, select Landscape.
* Click and drag in the level viewport to define the size of the landscape.
* Adjust the landscape settings, such as the number of components, section
size, and overall resolution, to fit your needs.
* Click the Create button to generate the landscape.

#### STEP 2: Sculpt and paint the landscape:

* With the landscape selected, go to the Landscape tab in the Modes panel.
* Use the Sculpt tools to modify the shape of the landscape, such as raising,
lowering, or smoothing the terrain.
* Use the Paint tools to apply different textures and materials to the
landscape, such as grass, dirt, or rocks.
* Experiment with different brushes and settings to achieve the desired look
for your landscape.

#### STEP 3: Add foliage to the landscape:

* In the Modes panel, under the Place tab, select Foliage.
* Choose the foliage type you want to add, such as trees, bushes, or flowers.
* Click and drag in the level viewport to place the foliage instances on the
landscape.
* Adjust the density, scale, rotation, and other parameters to achieve a
natural distribution of foliage.

#### STEP 4: Create and apply a landscape material:

* In the Content Browser, right-click in the desired folder.
* Select Materials & Textures > Material.
* Double-click the newly created material to open it in the Material Editor.
* Create the desired material setup by connecting nodes, textures, and
parameters.
* Connect a Landscape Layer Blend node to control the distribution of
different textures on the landscape.
* Assign the material to the landscape by selecting the landscape and
setting the Material property to the newly created material.

#### STEP 5: Configure landscape material layers:

* In the Landscape Layer Blend node, add layers for different textures.
* Set the Layer Info property of each layer to the appropriate landscape layer
info asset.
* Adjust the parameters of each layer, such as texture, tiling, and blending
settings.
* Use the brush tools in the Landscape tab to paint the landscape with
different textures based on the configured layers.

#### STEP 6: Refine and optimize the landscape:

* Fine-tune the landscape by adjusting the sculpting, painting, and foliage
placement.
* Optimize performance by adjusting the landscape LOD settings and culling
options.
* Experiment with different material settings and foliage variations to achieve
the desired visual quality and performance balance.

#### STEP 7: Test and iterate:

* Play the game in the editor to explore and experience the created
landscape.
* Make adjustments based on the visual and gameplay feedback, refining the
landscape and foliage as needed.
* Iterate on the design, adding more details, adjusting materials, and
optimizing performance until you achieve the desired result.
